    • This project has various parts that needs to be integrated separately and make them function with each other, the first part was creating the index page which will be the welcome page to the client it needed to have links to other page to enable the user to navigate throw the website, the second part was creating the departments pages that will show the products in regard to the category, third the user can navigate freely throw the website and can add and delete items  from the cart but in order to proceed to checkout he must be registered and logged in.
    • The hardest parts were the database as well as the checkout as it requires the use of an API to verify the payment so you have to abide by their rules.
    • The easy part was creating the pages and displaying the product and making the interaction throw the website
    • As future improvement the addition of admin page to insert and modify the products retributes is a must to simplify the addition, delete and update.
